# Meta-Analysis Protocol: Conserved Microglial Activation States in Alzheimer's Disease

## Objective
To identify and characterize conserved microglial activation states across multiple Alzheimer's disease single-cell RNA-sequencing studies through systematic meta-analysis.

## Research Questions
1. Are there conserved microglial activation states across different AD studies?
2. What are the core gene signatures of these activation states?
3. How do these states relate to disease progression and pathology?
4. Are there species-specific vs. conserved patterns?

## Study Design
### Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Systematic collection of AD scRNA-seq datasets containing microglia
- Quality control and standardization of count matrices
- Batch effect assessment and correction strategies

### Phase 2: Cell Type Annotation and Microglial Identification  
- Automated cell type annotation using CellTypist
- Manual validation of microglial populations
- Subpopulation identification within microglia

### Phase 3: Integration and Harmonization
- Cross-dataset integration using scANVI/Harmony
- Batch correction evaluation
- Reference mapping and label transfer

### Phase 4: Activation State Discovery
- Unsupervised clustering of integrated microglial populations
- Differential gene expression analysis
- Pathway enrichment analysis using GSEA
- Identification of conserved gene signatures

### Phase 5: Meta-Analysis
- Cross-study validation of activation states
- Statistical meta-analysis of effect sizes
- Species comparison (human vs. mouse)
- Clinical correlation analysis

## Expected Deliverables
1. Integrated microglial atlas across studies
2. Conserved activation state signatures
3. Interactive visualization dashboard  
4. Comprehensive analysis report
5. Reproducible analysis pipeline
